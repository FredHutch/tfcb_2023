# Lecture 09: Practical analyses in Python

This lecture will continue using Python to perform biological sequence analyses.
In particular, we will use [Biopython](https://biopython.org) to read in sequencing data and process sequences.

## Learning objectives

After this lecture, you should be able to:

- Read sequencing files into Python using `BioPython`
- Use `BioPython` methods to work with sequence data
- Parse barcodes from a real deep-sequencing experiment

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is containing in the Jupyter notebook [lecture09.ipynb](lecture09.ipynb) located in this directory. Some of the content from lecture 08 is duplicated here for your convenience.
