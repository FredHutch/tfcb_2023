# Lecture 17: Immune repertoire sequencing and analysis

In this lecture, we will introduce immune repertoire sequencing and practice working with the data.
Open [lecture17.ipynb](./lecture17.ipynb) and make sure to select the kernel for R so that you can execute R code.
You should already have this set up from the previous few lectures.

This lecture will begin with a introduction to immune repertoire sequencing and analysis. We will then undertake a hands-on exercise using R and Bioconductor tools to analyze pre-processed immune repertoire data from two healthy individuals.

## Learning Objectives 

The primary goal of this lecture is to have you apply your existing coding skills to a new data context. After today's lecture, you will hopefully have

- a basic understanding of immune repertoire sequencing
- a familiarity with immune repertoire data
- experience working through example repertoire analyses
    - visualizing rearrangement statistics
    - evaluating repertoire overlap between individuals
